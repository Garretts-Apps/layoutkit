# Changelog

All notable changes to `layoutkit-css` are documented here. This project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased (1.2.0)

Ergonomics pass: spend less effort styling, and stop thinking in raw-CSS
mechanics. All additive — nothing from 1.1 changes.

### Added
- **`place` — axis-agnostic alignment.** One attribute names *where children
  sit* (`center`, `top`, `bottom`, `start`, `end`, `top-start`, `top-end`,
  `bottom-start`, `bottom-end`) plus distribution (`between`, `around`,
  `evenly`). It's resolved per container, so the same word is visually
  consistent on rows and stacks — no more tracking which axis `align` vs
  `justify` controls. Works on `lk-stack`, `lk-row`, `lk-center`, `lk-spread`,
  and `lk-grid`. `align`/`justify` keep working as the low-level escape.
- **`flow` — vertical rhythm without per-item margins.** `<lk-box flow>` (or
  `flow="lg"`) spaces every flowing child via the owl selector — no more
  hand-placed `margin-bottom`. Works on `lk-box` and `lk-card`.
- **`width` — constrain & center.** `width="prose | xs…xl | full"` sets
  `max-inline-size` (prose = the reading measure) and centers via
  `margin-inline:auto`. Works on `lk-box`, `lk-card`, `lk-stack`, `lk-center`,
  `lk-row`. Replaces inline `max-width`.
- **Type scale — `lk-text` / `lk-weight`.** Namespaced attributes usable on any
  element (`<h2 lk-text="2xl" lk-weight="semibold">`). Sizes `xs…4xl` resolve
  through `--lk-text-*` → your `--text-*` tokens; weights `normal…bold`.
  Replaces inline `font-size`/`font-weight`.
- **`lk-card` — token-driven surface.** Padded block with radius and a
  brand-neutral `currentColor` border by default. Attributes `padding`,
  `radius` (`none…full`), `surface` (tinted fill), `border="none"`. Radius
  resolves through `--lk-radius-*` → your `--radius-*` tokens.

All new spacing/type/radius values are **enumerated attributes** (external-CSS
attribute selectors), so they work under a strict `style-src 'self'` CSP with no
inline styles. Arbitrary values remain available via the inline `--lk-*` escape
hatch (`--lk-measure`, `--lk-surface`, `--lk-card-border`, …).

## 1.1.0

Architecture pass to make LayoutKit compose with a design system rather than
run parallel to one. Default rendering is unchanged when no tokens are defined,
so this is backward-compatible.

### Added
- **Design-token spacing.** The semantic scale (`xs … 3xl`) now resolves through
  `--lk-space-*` custom properties that default to your `--space-*` tokens:
  `--lk-space-md: var(--space-md, 1rem)`. Define `--space-*` in your app and the
  whole `gap`/`padding` scale remaps onto it — no override per component. You can
  also override `--lk-space-*` directly.

### Changed
- **Cascade layer.** All rules are now declared inside `@layer layoutkit`, so a
  host app controls specificity relative to its own layers. Unlayered author
  styles always win, which makes overriding LayoutKit more predictable. If you
  rely on cascade layers, place `layoutkit` where you want it in your order.
- **Logical properties.** Directional box-model now uses logical properties
  (`border-inline-start`, `border-block-start`, `inline-size`, `block-size`,
  `min-block-size`, `max-inline-size`, …) so layouts follow writing mode and RTL.
  In left-to-right, top-to-bottom contexts the rendering is identical.

## 1.0.0

First stable release: a complete rewrite to a single pure-CSS stylesheet.

### Changed
- LayoutKit is now **pure CSS** — it styles semantic `<lk-*>` tags via attribute
  selectors. No JavaScript, no runtime, no build step, no FOUC. (0.1.0 shipped
  React components that compiled to Tailwind.)

### Removed
- **`index.d.ts`** and all JavaScript/TypeScript entry points. A pure-CSS package
  has no JS API to type, so the type definitions were dropped. **Breaking** for
  anyone importing the 0.1.0 component/types API — there is no JS surface in 1.x;
  import the stylesheet instead: `import "layoutkit-css/layoutkit.css"`.
